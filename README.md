## Features
### Data
The viewer has the ability to show several types of data, from raw totals for Wake and their opponent to more advanced analytics.
* Use the `Season` dropdown to change the year.
* The `Game` dropdown allows the user to filter by the whole season, conference games, or individual games.
* The `Stat Type` dropdown filters by raw data, net +/-, advanced per possession data, and shooting data.
* The `Group` dropdown switches between lineups, individual players, and year-to-year. The individiual stats are stats for the TEAM while that player is on the court. The year-to-year data is the team as a whole for an entire season.
* The `Poss Limit` switch will filter out any lineups that didn't meet the possession requirement of 1 possession per game.
